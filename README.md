# Dask Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides Dask integration in VS Code.

## Features

In the preview [Native Notebooks](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/notebooks-are-getting-revamped/#how-to-try-out-native-notebooks) interface, you can conveniently open a Dask dashboard from your VS Code notebook with a single click:

Or directly invoke the 'Dask: Connect to Existing Dask Dashboard' command to view your running Dask dashboard right next to your notebooks within VS Code.
